<h1>Ciphers</h1>
<p>This project encrypts, decrypts and cracks the following ciphers:</p> 
<ul><li>Rotation Ciphers</li><li>Vigenere Ciphers</li><li>Autokey Ciphers</li><li>Route Ciphers</li></ul>
<p>The autopkey cipher maps the second half of the alphabet to the odd letters ([b,d,f...]) in order to be bijective. 
   To compile, import the project into IntelliJ. The standalone .jar is also included in out/artifacts.</p>
